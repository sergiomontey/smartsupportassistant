# Hybrid Chatbot Architecture Guide  
*Scalable, Multi-Channel NLP Chatbot with Zendesk/Freshdesk Integration*

## üß± Core Architecture Overview

### Hybrid Deployment Strategy
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript hosted via CDN (CloudFront/S3)
- **Backend**:
  - Lightweight endpoints (auth, handoff) via AWS Lambda
  - Heavy NLP workloads on ECS/EKS containers w/ FastAPI
- **State Management**:
  - Short-lived session data in Redis (Elasticache)
  - Long-term logs in PostgreSQL or DynamoDB

### Integration Targets
- **Zendesk & Freshdesk APIs** for ticket creation and user mapping
- **Slack/Microsoft Teams** for agent notifications
- **Embeddable Widget Loader**: Lightweight JS snippet (~20KB gzipped)

## üöÄ Scalability Best Practices

### Component Isolation
- Use serverless for elastic workloads
- Offload NLP-intensive tasks to GPU-powered containers
- Redis-based context TTL cleanup to preserve memory

### Load Optimization
- Lazy-load chat widget post-user interaction
- Cache repeated intents/entities
- Batch low-confidence ticket creation to reduce API costs

### Session Strategy
- TTL-driven Redis storage for short sessions
- Store session metadata (userId, locale, channel)
- PostgreSQL/DynamoDB for transcripts and audit logs

---

## üß† NLP Strategy

### Engine Design
- Remote API calls to OpenAI/HuggingFace
- In-memory fallback to spaCy/DistilBERT models
- Intent caching for top queries

### Fallback Handling
- Regex and keyword rules for simple intents
- Confidence thresholds for human escalation
- Rule-based prioritization when ML confidence is low

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Patterns

### FastAPI Microservices
- `/api/nlp`: Intent and entity extraction
- `/api/context`: Redis-based session logic
- `/api/handoff`: Creates Zendesk/Freshdesk tickets
- `/api/notify`: Slack/Teams integration

### React Frontend
- Widget loaded via `<script>` tag and lazy-initialized
- Uses `useChatState` hook and JWT-authenticated API calls
- Styled via TailwindCSS and customizable props

---

## üîÑ CI/CD Deployment

### CI Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Run lint/test on feature branches
- Build + tag Docker images
- Deploy to ECS (for containers) or via Serverless CLI (Lambda)
- CDN upload for widget assets with cache-busting

### CD Strategy
- Canary rollout via Lambda aliases or ECS task versions
- Slack notification hooks on success/fail
- Infra-as-Code via Terraform/CDK for consistent provisioning

---

## üîê Security & Compliance

- JWT-based auth stored in secure cookies
- All input sanitized server-side
- Webhook signature verification for Zendesk/Freshdesk
- TLS encryption on all data in transit

---

## üßÆ Analytics & Reporting

- Log each turn in a time-series DB (InfluxDB or CloudWatch Logs)
- Dashboard: Deflection rate, ticket escalations, confidence heatmaps
- Real-time metrics feeding autoscaling policy adjustments
